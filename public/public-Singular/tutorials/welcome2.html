  <h4>Getting started</h4>

  <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

  <p>Every tutorial usually consists of a number of pages, with highlighted Singular
  code.</p>

  <p>If you click or tap on the highlighted Singular code, the code will
  be sent to the server, and evaluated.  The result will be displayed in the right hand window.
  For example</p>

  <code>2+2;</code><br>
  <code>LIB "poly.lib";</code><br>
  <code>ring r=0,(a,b,c,d,e,f),lp;</code><br>
  <code>ideal I=cyclic(6);</code><br>
  <code>ideal GI=groebner(I);</code><br>
  <code>GI;</code><br>
  
  <p>If you are already familiar with Singular and know some commands, you
    can type them directly in the right hand window. </p>


  <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the window, you see how many pages are
  in this tutorial.  After you are finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow key.  You can also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the left arrow button.</p>

  <p>Right now, please continue to the next page of the tutorial.</p>

    <h4>Using the <b>Input</b> Window</h4>


    <p>When you write Singular functions or long loops, it is often more convenient to write your code
      in a separate window and execute the code after you wrote it. This allows you to easily modify previous code and
      move the cursor around freely. </p>
    
    <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Input</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the Input Window.
      This is where you may type in Singular code and have it evaluated.
      Moreover, this window keeps track of everything you type into Singular at the right hand side.</p>

    <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
      <b>Evaluate</b> button, or press Shift-Return (both keys at the same time).
      Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and have them evaluated.</p>

  <!-- <p>You try it!  Click <b>Input</b>, type in some Singular input, or try out some of the example -->
  <!-- lines already there.  When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the -->
  <!-- <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here! -->

    <p><b>To save your work:</b>
      Click on the <b>Save</b> button at the top right of the window.  A dialog will appear
      where you can save the text in the <b>Input</b> window, or the text in the Singular <b>Output</b> (or both).
      Alternatively, you can just select the text you wish, and copy it.
    </p>

  <h4>Singular sessions and the Reset button</h4>

  <p> When your browser starts, it starts a Singular process on our server.
  All of your input, either typed and evaluated, or run by pressing buttons,
  goes to this process.  If you open a second window or tab in the same
  browser, you will get the same session.
  </p>

  <p>
  You might wish to start fresh, or restart Singular, if a computation is
  going on too long.  In this case, press the <b>Reset</b> button at the top of
  the page.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you first connect to this web site, a cookie is generated, and that is used to connect to
  your Singular process on the server.  If you quit your browser, and it is set to remember windows, then
  it remembers the cookie, and you can reconnect back to the same session.  If not, then a new session
  is created.  The server will remove the session after some length of time, currently several days or a week.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sometimes the server must be restarted for maintenance or other reasons, and at those times, all sessions
  are terminated.

  <h4>Advanced topics</h4>
  <h4>Uploading files</h4>

  <p>Use the <b>Upload File</b> button to upload files to the Singular server that can then be loaded into your Singular session. Suppose that you have uploaded a file named <tt>foo.lib</tt> which contains Singular code.
  You may then load this file into Singular using either:
  </p>

  <code>LIB "foo.lib";</code><br>


  <p><b>Note</b>: these lines will likely give errors now, as the file
    <tt>foo.lib</tt> probably doesn't exist on the server!</p>

  <h4>Running shell commands in your Singular session</h4>

  <p>It is possible to run shell commands from within Singular, although many operations are restricted.
  For example, to see what files you have in your home directory on the server, try:</p>

  <code>system("sh", "ls -la");</code>


  <h4>Getting files back to your machine</h4>

  <p>
  Sometimes your Singular code will create a file as output.  How to download
  this onto your machine?  Here is one way.  This first line creates a file for
  the purpose of this example.
  </p>


  <p>The next line will present a download dialog for you to obtain the file on your machine.
  </p>


  <h4>Restrictions in place for the Singular server</h4>

  <p>The server is being shared with other users, therefore memory and CPU time
  are limited (generous, but limited).  Other restrictions include: upload file size, number of processes that
  can run, and the amount of time that the session is saved on the server.
  </p>
